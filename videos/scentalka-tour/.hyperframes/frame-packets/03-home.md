narrativeRole: Turn the first environment into a legible, low-stakes speaking loop.
keyMessage: Everyday objects create concrete language practice.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.4s): Open on the Home map in a layered-depth 60/40 layout; the camera cursor tracking move (`camera-cursor-tracking`) starts on the living room and locks to the character.
Scene 2 (2.4–5.0s): The bedroom, living room, kitchen, and entrance labels reveal as a short spatial-pan-stations move (`viewport-change`), while the phrase “a key, a message” lands as two sequential highlights.
Scene 3 (5.0–7.6s): A cursor click + ripple (`cursor-click-ripple`) moves to Sarah's conversation panel; the message card opens and the private IM label appears only when the narration reaches “someone familiar.”
Scene 4 (7.6–10.0s): Crossfade to the pocket state; the key and phone stay in the record while the map holds. No extra motion after the evidence becomes readable.

## Selected blueprint: cursor-ui-demo

# cursor-ui-demo — Cursor-Driven UI Demo

**intent**: A visible custom cursor drives a real (reconstructed) app UI through clicks / hovers / drags so the screen changes state shot-to-shot, while the camera chases each interaction — the product surface is the subject and the cursor is the actor.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-cursor-ui-demo`): first look at the product surface — the cursor sweeps/hovers to \_introduce\* the app and reveal what it is, landing on a hovered hero element or freshly-popped result. Light, exploratory; backdrop steps colors as it goes.
- Key_Feature (from `key-feature-cursor-ui-demo`): one specific multi-step workflow demonstrated \_end-to-end\* (edit / configure / select across 2–4 discrete beats), each beat a real edit the UI responds to live, landing locked on the primary action button or the produced result.
- Key_Feature (from `workflow-approve-press`): an agency / confirmation workflow framed by a cockpit of 3D-tilted flanks — a step list ticks pending → active → complete (a snap state machine, CSS responding to `[data-state]`), and a flank button takes the PRESS as the payoff (its color flips to success, a checkmark stamps). The click is the climax, not a passing gesture.
- Key_Feature (from `cursor-app-state-tour`): the static-stage STATE TOUR — the cursor drives a reconstructed app through 2–4 discrete feature states on a LOCKED frame; every scene change is a click-triggered element swap/scale (modal springs from center, side panel slides in from the right edge, settings hard-swap, table populates, node-graph builds), never a real camera move; optional `[title card]` Scene 0 in front and a `[brand end beat]` behind.
- Key_Feature (from `drag-field-onto-document`): the DRAG-DROP journey — one continuous zoom-breathing shot of a document workspace: the cursor drags a ghosted `[field chip]` from an inputs sidebar onto the page, drop-snaps it into a placed field, a modal/typing beat completes it, and the placed element is adjusted in close-up before the cursor heads to the `[Finish/CTA]`.
- Product_Intro: the low-event BROWSE — the cursor roams ONE clean page state and the filter controls answer with slight hover updates; no typed input, no title beats, and the shot may end mid-roam.
- Product_Intro (from `hover-inspect-run`): the HOVER-INSPECT run — a click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms out from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` while a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, outline-highlighting and content-snapping per hovered element. (The slice's three-beat dark title prelude, scenes 1–3, belongs to `titlecard-reveal`, not here.)
- Hook: the ambient MULTI-CURSOR canvas — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` work a design canvas simultaneously (grab-drag-drop of components between mockups, recolor/identity swaps on drop) while the canvas group translate-PANS within a static frame and a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the demo; the live workshop itself is the hook. One continuous beat, no cuts, no camera.
- Benefits (from `ui-demo-text-interlude-ui-demo`): the demo|text|demo SANDWICH — two static-stage demo beats of this blueprint bridge through a full-screen kinetic/title interlude and back (cursor acts, UI answers, all "zoom" element scale); the interlude beat is `kinetic-type-beats` material, and the sandwich itself is sequencing above the single-shot unit.

**duration**: 4.0–12.9s (Key_Feature 4.0–12.9s — the mined state tours run long, 10.4–12.9s, and the drag-drop journeys 9.8–10.6s, against the original 4.0–7.3s set; Product_Intro 4.5–9.3s — the low-event browse sets the 4.5s floor; Hook ~6.5s; the Benefits demo|text|demo sandwich totals 11.6–12.8s with each demo half ~4–5s)

**shot structure** (a `[product UI surface]` — fixed app window, dashboard/editor, parallax `[content card]` stack, or a `[container object/icon]` — centered over `[bg color/gradient]`, shown `[flat]` or `[3D-isometric]`; a custom `[brand-colored cursor with icon]` is the protagonist and the camera servos to whatever it touches; UI responds _live_ and in sync with each cursor action. Two role-tuned tempos fold in — Product_Intro **sweeps to introduce**, Key_Feature **performs a workflow** — and the camera spans a spectrum: the full CHASE, one continuous zoom-breathe, or a fully LOCKED static stage where the UI itself does all the moving.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~Xs) — surface establishes + first touch.** The `[product UI surface]` arrives centered over `[bg color/gradient]` — either it is simply present (fixed window / dashboard / editor), a 3D-parallax stack of `[content cards]`, or a `[container object/icon]` that FLIES IN with a 3D tumble and settles. The custom `[cursor]` enters. The cursor performs the FIRST action on `[cursor target 1]` and the UI responds live in the same beat. Camera holds or begins a slow push-in toward the acted-on region.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: low-commitment first touch — cursor HOVERS/sweeps a control or SWEEP-HIGHLIGHTS a field to `[accent color]`, OR the `[container]` fans open. An optional label/title fades/morphs onto the surface. The point is to _show the surface exists_ and is touchable.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: a concrete edit — cursor DRAGS a scrollbar / TYPES into a field / DRAGS a handle, and the UI responds materially (`[scroll]` / value climbs / region resizes). If the surface opened in `[3D-isometric]`, it may snap perspective-FLAT here to read the workflow.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: an optional Scene 0 — `[title card / kinetic brand word]` on a flat field — hard-cuts or window-SCALES-UP into the surface; the `[app UI]` is fully present from the first frame and the cursor enters and glides to the first control. The camera is LOCKED from the start and stays locked.
  - _Variant — Hook (ambient multi-cursor)_: no single protagonist — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` are already at work across `[N mockups]` on a design canvas; the canvas group translate-PANS within the static frame while a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the top. One continuous beat, no cuts.

- **Scene 2 (~Xs–~Ys) — camera chases to the next interaction (the engine).** The camera MOVES to the next target — push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to `[cursor target k]` — and the cursor performs action k as the UI updates live. Each beat is a discrete interaction connected by a fast camera move; the surface's inner content SWAPS per interaction.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: navigation is exploratory — a slow camera pan + depth-of-field FOCUS-PULL across a parallax `[content card]` stack, or the `[container]` fanning into `[N option/content cards]` that SPRING to position. As content swaps, the supporting backdrop STEPS its color (`[bg step 1]` → step 2 → …). Typically one or two such moves.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: repeat for `[2–4 beats total]`, each a distinct operation the UI answers — counter COUNTS UP, `[pill/swatch]` SELECTS, a modal SLIDES UP and TYPES — connected by whip-pans / progressive zoom. The workflow visibly advances toward a result.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: the camera never moves — every beat is a click-triggered ELEMENT response: a modal SPRINGS/scales up from center, a `[side detail panel]` SLIDES in from the right edge (a second panel may slide over the first), hamburger→sidebar slide-open, a settings panel HARD-swaps its content, a dropdown fills, a `[table]` populates row-by-row, a formula types into a cell and the range populates on enter, a type-to-filter list live-collapses, a `[block]` pops into the canvas, a node-graph BUILDS (cards + connecting lines radiate from center), a hover drops a `[popover]` below a tag. Any "zoom" is element scale of the UI only.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: the cursor GRABS a `[field chip]` from an `[inputs sidebar]`, drags a semi-transparent GHOST across the page, and drops it — it SNAPS into a placed field with bounding box + corner handles; a completion beat follows (a `[modal]` springs up over the dimmed document, a name types letter-by-letter while a live `[cursive preview]` builds per keystroke, confirm click). The whole clip rides one continuous zoom-BREATHING arc (slow zoom-out / gentle zoom-in / final zoom-out) instead of discrete camera beats.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (hover-inspect)_: the cursor's first click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms OUT from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` — each hovered element gets an outline and a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, its content snapping per element.

- **Scene 3 (~Ys–end) — payoff state, camera settles, HOLD.** The cursor lands on its final target and the screen reaches the payoff state; the camera comes to rest (static) and holds.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the cursor HOVERS the hero element — a `[content card]` SCALES UP on hover, a node gets an `[Available]`-style pill, or a `[result card]` POPS/springs in — the "here's the product" payoff. Settles static, holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: locked close-up on the OUTCOME — cursor lands on the `[primary action button: Export / Save / Reimburse]` and a `[hover backdrop / highlight]` SPRING-pops in (the climax is the action button / produced result). Holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: optional detachable end beat — `[brand text beat / icon-ring lockup / end stat card]` — or the cursor simply comes to REST on the next target and holds (006_claudeai ends with the cursor on a panel's close X, the panel never closing).
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: close-up on the placed element ADJUSTED — a corner-handle drag proportionally resizes it — then the cursor sweeps toward the `[Finish / CTA]` as the clip ends.
  - _Variant — browse / hover-inspect_: no payoff lock at all — the shot ends MID-demo, cursor still roaming (browse and hover-inspect modes).

**rule mapping**

- viewport follows the cursor / camera servos to whatever it touches (primary) → `camera-cursor-tracking`
- cursor moves to a target, presses, emits a ripple (the click itself — primary interaction primitive) → `cursor-click-ripple`
- screen-state swap shot-to-shot (surface inner content changes between beats) → `scale-swap-transition`
- camera push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to the next target → `viewport-change` (pan/zoom across the UI)
- sequencing the chase into discrete interaction beats → `multi-phase-camera`
- zoom onto the specific acted-on UI region → `coordinate-target-zoom`
- cursor icon/state changing with context (e.g. pointer↔grab over a draggable handle) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- which content appears per beat / step-by-step UI state progression / per-interaction swaps → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- sweep-highlight a field, highlight a UI keyword to `[accent color]` → `asr-keyword-glow` (keyword glow on the touched element)
- clicked button compresses on press, springs back on release → `press-release-spring`
- cursor + button compress together on a heavier press → `physics-press-reaction`
- panel/card morphs between two states (e.g. card → expanded card, surface state A → B) → `card-morph-anchor`
- terminal hover-scale, `[result card]` pop-in, spring hover-backdrop on the final action button → `spring-pop-entrance`
- card fan-out to corners / option cards springing to position → `split-tilt-cards` (fan/spread into tilted positions) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the spring settle)
- 3D-parallax content-card stack as the surface; UI shown 3D-isometric → `3d-page-scroll` (UI as a tilted scrolling/parallax card)
- node gets an `[Available]`-style pill / tracked badge appears on an element → `ai-tracking-box`
- counter / value count-up as the UI responds → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- a result bar / number FILLS as the workflow's outcome → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- a live `[video]` screen-capture clip used as the surface → technique: video compositing
- perspective-flatten (3D-isometric → flat 2D snap) and the 3D-isometric tilt itself → technique: CSS-3D (no dedicated rule; the tilt/flatten transform is a CSS-3D primitive)
- camera settles static on the payoff and HOLDS → (settle phase of `spring-pop-entrance` on the payoff element; the static hold itself needs no rule)
- 3D container/object fly-in & tumble-settle → `depth-scatter-assemble` (free-tumbling 3D object/container entrance that flies in and tumble-settles; `orbit-3d-entry` only orbits a flat element into place)
- depth-of-field focus-pull across the parallax card stack → `depth-of-field-blur` (rack-focus / DoF blur transition between near and far cards; `3d-page-scroll` supplies the tilted parallax stack and `viewport-change` the pan)
- paginated/stepped backdrop color advance synced to interactions (`[bg step 1]`→step 2→…) → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping, here applied to a background-color state rather than text)
- modal slide-up + in-modal typing as one combined beat → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel slide-in) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the in-modal typed text)
- element-scale fake zoom — the UI window scales, camera locked (static-stage tour) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (applied to the surface wrapper rather than the world)
- side detail panel slide-in from the right edge / hamburger→sidebar slide-open / hover popover drop → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel arrival) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (which content each panel shows per beat)
- hard panel swap / in-panel content snapping through states / hover-triggered micro update / type-to-filter live-collapse / element identity swap on drop → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- table populates row-by-row / fill-handle auto-fill cascading down rows / log rows cascade in → `waterfall-entry`
- formula typed into a cell / character-by-character auto-typing with blinking caret / letter-by-letter typed name → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (the caret)
- node-graph build (cards + connecting lines radiate from center) → `center-outward-expansion` (the cards) + `svg-path-draw` (the connecting lines draw)
- click spawns a labeled toolbar / dropdown fills on click / drop-snap settle of the placed field / window scale-up with settle → `spring-pop-entrance`
- modal spring-up over a dimming document → `spring-pop-entrance` (the modal) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the document dim/blur beneath)
- ghost-chip drag-and-drop / cursor grab-drag of components between mockups / fill-handle drag / corner-handle resize drag → `cursor-drag` (`cursor-click-ripple` covers move+click only)
- floating inspector panel TRACKS the cursor, content snapping per element → `ai-tracking-box` (the per-frame follow mechanics, restyled as an inspector panel) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (the per-element content)
- live cursive preview building per typed keystroke → `svg-path-draw` (progressive stroke reveal keyed to typing progress)
- continuous zoom-breathing single shot (drag-drop variant) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back / focus / push phases + micro-drift)
- motion-blur window fly-in / tight-crop open then zoom-out to full page → `motion-blur-streak` (the fly-in) + `viewport-change` (the zoom-out)
- multiple labeled collaborative cursors moving independently → `multi-cursor-choreography` (N labeled independent cursor actors; the single-actor cursor rules assume one)
- canvas-group translate-pan within a static frame → `viewport-change` (the `.world` translate realizes the pan; semantically the camera stays locked)
- headline builds word-group by word-group over the demo → `waterfall-entry`
- brand icon-ring end beat → `svg-path-draw` (the ring) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the lockup)
- 3D end-card float on the hold → `sine-wave-loop` — CAUTION: motion-doctrine bans idle wobble; prefer a settle-and-hold

**camera modifier**: The defining motion is the camera CHASE — the viewport follows the cursor from target to target via `camera-cursor-tracking` (primary), realized as concrete push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down moves under `viewport-change`, sequenced into discrete interaction beats by `multi-phase-camera`, with each beat's destination targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom to the acted-on region). Product_Intro biases toward a slow, exploratory pan + focus-pull that sweeps the surface; Key_Feature biases toward snappier whip-pans / progressive zoom that march through the workflow and lock static on the action button. This camera-servo-to-cursor is what separates the blueprint from hands-off camera scrolls (dataviz-scroll-reveal) and static device/window tours. The golden set widens this into a spectrum. At one pole the **static-stage state tour** (now the largest member set) LOCKS the camera for the entire clip and lets the UI itself do all the moving — panel slide-ins, element-scale fake zooms, content snaps — with the cursor alone carrying the eye. The **drag-drop** variant replaces discrete chase beats with ONE continuous zoom-breathing arc under `multi-phase-camera`. The **hover-inspect** variant inverts the push-in: a tight-crop open zooms OUT to the full page before the cursor sweep. Pick the pole per brief — chase for workflow marches, locked stage for dense reconstructed dashboards, a single breathe for one-document journeys. With the locked pole absorbed, what separates this blueprint from `device-surface-showcase` is the CURSOR-as-actor, not the camera: a fully static tour still belongs here as long as a visible cursor drives every state change.

# Two-Phase Camera Cursor Tracking

## Contents

- [See also](#see-also)

Keeps a horizontally-growing element (a search bar with typing text, a long URL animating in) visible by switching between two camera modes.

## How It Works

Separate **World Space** (the full target element with all content) from **Screen Space** (the viewport). Two phases:

- **Phase 1 (Static)** — the world container sits at a fixed initial offset; the camera doesn't move. Anchors the viewer's eye before tracking begins.
- **Phase 2 (Tracking)** — activates when the focal point (cursor, highlight, last typed glyph) exceeds a target screen position (`CURSOR_TARGET_FRACTION × viewportWidth` from the left). The world translates leftward (`x: -delta`) keeping the focal point pinned at that screen position.

The offset math is **mathematically continuous** at the phase boundary — at the instant tracking starts, the world position equals what the static phase had, so the transition is seamless. The piecewise form:

```
finalWorldX = Math.min(INITIAL_OFFSET, trackingOffset)
```

`INITIAL_OFFSET` is the static-phase value; `trackingOffset` is whatever shift keeps the focal point at the target screen X. While the focal point hasn't grown past the target, `trackingOffset` is a less-negative number and `Math.min` returns the static value; once the focal point would cross the target, `trackingOffset` overtakes and tracking takes over. Do NOT replace this with a hard `if (typingProgress > threshold)` branch — the camera will visibly jump.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="viewport">
  <div class="world">
    <div class="search-bar">
      <span class="text" id="reveal-text">{phrase}</span><span class="cursor">|</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.viewport {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  overflow: hidden; /* clip the world's left edge as it pans off-screen */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  padding-left: VIEWPORT_PAD_LEFT; /* Phase-1 anchor X — must match the JS constant */
}
.world {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  white-space: nowrap; /* text must stay on one line for the camera math */
}
.search-bar .text {
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  vertical-align: bottom;
}
.search-bar .cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline sibling of the text, NOT absolutely positioned —
     absolute positioning misaligns with the camera math */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
  margin-left: CURSOR_GAP;
  background: {accentColor};
  height: CURSOR_HEIGHT_EM;
  vertical-align: bottom;
  /* no CSS blink animation — CSS clocks don't sync to seek; blink is a GSAP tween below */
}
```

```js
// Pre-measure the target text width to compute tracking distance.
// Measure SYNCHRONOUSLY — no fonts.ready gate (see Critical Constraints).
const textEl = document.getElementById("reveal-text");
const targetCursorScreenX = CURSOR_TARGET_FRACTION * VIEWPORT_WIDTH;
const fullWidth = textEl.scrollWidth; // total text width after full reveal
const trackingDelta = Math.max(0, VIEWPORT_PAD_LEFT + fullWidth - targetCursorScreenX);

// Phase 1 — text reveals progressively; camera holds. maxWidth tween
// (width/left/top tweens are forbidden); ease "none" = linear typing rate.
tl.fromTo(
  ".search-bar .text",
  { maxWidth: 0 },
  { maxWidth: fullWidth, duration: REVEAL_DUR, ease: "none" },
  REVEAL_START,
);

// Phase 2 — camera tracks. Start BEFORE full reveal so the handoff feels
// continuous (Math.min form above makes it mathematically continuous).
tl.to(".world", { x: -trackingDelta, duration: TRACK_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" }, TRACK_START);

// Cursor blink — finite GSAP yoyo (never CSS @keyframes; CSS animation clocks
// aren't synced to HF's seek and flicker non-deterministically).
const blinkRepeats = Math.ceil(SCENE_DURATION / BLINK_HALF_PERIOD) - 1;
tl.to(
  ".search-bar .cursor",
  { opacity: 0, duration: BLINK_HALF_PERIOD, ease: "steps(1)", yoyo: true, repeat: blinkRepeats },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Centered → center-tracked**: `.viewport { justify-content: center; padding: 0; }`, `CURSOR_TARGET_FRACTION = 0.5` — tracks once the focal point crosses the midline.
- **Left-aligned → right-tracked**: as written; best when content exceeds viewport width from the start.
- **Continuous typing driver**: replace the `maxWidth` tween with an `onUpdate` typing clock (`charsTyped = Math.floor(progress)`) plus per-frame `measureNodeWidth` driving the cursor screen X — required when the typed text is consumed elsewhere in the scene (e.g. by a parent strip's camera offset).

| BLINK_HALF_PERIOD      | 0.2–0.4s                    | `steps(1)` hard on/off; repeats derived from SCENE_DURATION (= `data-duration`) |

## Critical Constraints

- **Build the timeline SYNCHRONOUSLY — no `fonts.ready` gate.** HF renders frames in parallel workers, each a fresh browser. A `document.fonts.ready.then(...)` wrapper means some workers seek frames BEFORE the Promise resolves and find no timeline → those frames render at CSS initial state (`max-width: 0` ⇒ empty text) while others render correctly → visible flicker. Register the timeline at script-parse time: the camera math tolerates a few percent width error from fallback-font measurement; worker-race flicker is unacceptable. If precise post-font measurement matters, re-measure inside the tween's `onUpdate` (still deterministic per-frame), or set `font-display: block` on the @font-face.
- **Measure with `getBoundingClientRect()` / `scrollWidth` / probe nodes**, never character count × font-size — proportional fonts have variable glyph widths.
- **Continuous math at the phase boundary** — the `Math.min(INITIAL_OFFSET, trackingOffset)` form, never a hard threshold branch.
- **`white-space: nowrap` on the world** and pre-allocated width (tween `maxWidth` to the full target width) — prevents layout shift mid-tween.
- **Cursor is an inline sibling of the text**, and blinks via a finite GSAP yoyo — never CSS `@keyframes … infinite`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.viewport`** — clips the world as it pans.

# Cursor Click Ripple

An animated cursor moves to a target element, performs a click with visual depression, and emits expanding ripple rings from the click point. Three sequential phases on one timeline: **move** (eased translation to the target's center) → **click** (scale depression on cursor + target together, yoyo back) → **ripple** (1–3 staggered rings expand and fade from the click point). This is a _point event at one location_ — a sustained hold across space is [cursor-drag.md](cursor-drag.md).

## Recipe

```html
<button class="target-button">{ctaLabel}</button>
<div class="cursor"><!-- arrow SVG, positioned at the entry corner --></div>
<!-- Rings live in DOM from t=0 at the click-target CENTER, scale 0 + opacity 0 -->
<div class="ripple ripple-1"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-2"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-3"></div>
```

```css
.ripple {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* click-target center */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid {rippleColor};
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0);
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

```js
// Phase 1 — Move: eased, not linear
tl.to(".cursor", { x: TARGET_X, y: TARGET_Y, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE }, 0);

// Phase 2 — Click: cursor + target depress together, then return
tl.to(
  ".cursor",
  { scale: CURSOR_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);
tl.to(
  ".target-button",
  { scale: TARGET_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — Ripple burst, N rings staggered from the click point
tl.set([".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"], { opacity: 1 }, RIPPLE_AT);
tl.to(
  [".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"],
  {
    scale: RIPPLE_SCALE,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: RIPPLE_DUR,
    ease: RIPPLE_EASE,
    stagger: RIPPLE_STAGGER,
    immediateRender: false, // holds scale 0 / opacity 0 until the click moment
  },
  RIPPLE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Single ring** — one `.ripple`, no stagger; more elegant when the rest of the scene is busy.
- **Keyframed attack-decay** — a `keyframes` block ramps opacity 0 → peak → 0 across the duration; a clearer "energy radiates and dissipates" envelope.
- **Multi-ring expanding pulse** — 3 rings at 0.08 s stagger when the click is the scene's climactic moment.

Reference values: `../examples/cta-orbit-collapse.html` — 0.5 s move on `back.out(1.3)`, click +0.2 s, press 0.08 s at 0.85/0.95, single ring to 5× over 0.7 s `power2.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **Move before click** — trigger the click only after the move tween settles; clicking mid-motion reads as unintentional.
- **Rings live in DOM from t=0** at the click-target center with `scale: 0` + `opacity: 0` — never conditionally rendered; `immediateRender: false` on the expand so they hold invisible until the trigger.
- **Ripple from the click point** — the button's visual center, not any element's bounding-box origin.
- **Synchronized depression** — cursor + target depress at the same position with the same duration, and both yoyo back.
- **Cursor above all content** (high z-index) for the whole sequence; `pointer-events: none` on cursor + ripples.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>

```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */

}
.world {

  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
