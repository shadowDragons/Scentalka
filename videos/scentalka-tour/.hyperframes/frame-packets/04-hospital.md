narrativeRole: Demonstrate that the product supports a real multi-step service encounter, not isolated flashcards.
keyMessage: A practical visit becomes a sequence the learner can understand and control.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.8s): The hospital screenshot enters as a wide 70/30 split with the map dominant; a zoom-to-target (`coordinate-target-zoom`) lands on Reception while “check in” appears.
Scene 2 (2.8–5.5s): Appointment, ID, Reception, and Waiting Area cards assemble one at a time (`center-outward-expansion`) in the lower strip; each card reveals on its spoken cue.
Scene 3 (5.5–8.5s): The camera focuses the Consultation room; the doctor conversation panel arrives with an in-place token cycle (`discrete-text-sequence`) from “listen” to “ask” to “continue.”
Scene 4 (8.5–10.5s): The Pharmacy panel slides in from the right using a cut-the-curve seam, preserving the hospital map as a dim background.
Scene 5 (10.5–12.0s): Itinerary screenshot holds as a quiet summary: six steps, one completed visit, one learner in control.

## Selected blueprint: grid-card-assemble

# grid-card-assemble — Grid / Card Assemble

**intent**: N items (tiles / cards / logos / list-lines) self-assemble in a staggered cascade into a grid or vertical list and hold — a "look how much / who / what it does" beat that enumerates breadth at once; an optional camera zoom-OUT pulls back to reveal the assembled array sitting inside a vaster whole.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-card-grid-assemble): a grid of labeled feature tiles/pills (icon + label) cascades one-by-one into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid, then holds near-static with a slow push-in — enumerate many capabilities, no live UI, no cursor.
- Key_Feature (from key-feature-glass-card-camera-reveal): open TIGHT on 2–3 glowing icons; a camera zoom-OUT unfolds a row of glassmorphism cards that grow from behind the icons (icons shrink to card headers), center card scales forward, the group floats, then sweeps out — a "pillars revealed at once" reveal variant of the same assemble shape.
- Benefits (from benefits-vertical-list): short value phrases populate a single vertical list ~1 item/sec, co-resident and accumulating; each line enters via a spring marker-pop + check-draw + pill mask-wipe, OR the whole stack snaps up one slot per beat (slot-machine) so the newest lands in the bright focal slot.
- Social_Proof (from social-proof-logo-grid-zoom-out): a wall of partner/app logos builds into a center grid (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up), an optional headline + accent-gradient proof-number fills in above, then a continuous camera zoom-OUT shrinks the array to reveal a vast ecosystem; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional grid slide-up fly-out exit.
- Key_Feature (from live-data-populate-board): the array assembles by POPULATING ITSELF — skeleton pills fill and swap to real data, cards spring in tethered to map markers — and its state keeps flipping live after assembly (status pills stepping through states); no cursor, locked frame. The "look how much" beat becomes "look, it's doing it right now."
- Benefits (from item-field-to-payoff-card): a breadth FIELD — a rapidly streaming list past a fixed focal slot, or a chip array with one highlighted hero — plays its breadth motion, then CLEARS to concise centered payoff text (claim / price / URL end card). The array is the argument's setup; the payoff line is its landing.

**duration**: 3.0–10.5s (Social_Proof 3.0–6s · live-populate 4.2–7.8s · Key_Feature grid 5.8–7.3s · Benefits stream/field-to-payoff 5.9–8.4s · Key_Feature glass-card 6.5s · Benefits list 6.5–10.5s, scaling ~1 item/sec with count)

**shot structure** (consolidated template — concrete motion verbs, [slots])

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s) — open + first arrivals.** On a `[gradient / radial / dark background]` (optional `[dot-grid / drifting-watermark]` texture), an empty `[grid or list region]` is established and items begin to ASSEMBLE in a quick staggered cascade (~0.04–0.08s gap; list pacing ~1 item/sec). Each `[item: feature tile / pill / logo tile / benefit line]` fades + slides/scales a short distance directly into its slot (low drama — no scatter, no big bounce; spring overshoot reserved for accent markers). Camera static. An opening `[headline / hook]` may fill in line-by-line above the array, with any `[proof number]` counting up in an `[accent gradient]`.
- **Scene 2 (~1.0s–~Xs) — array resolves + holds.** Remaining items finish arriving; layout resolves into the final `[2-col-brick / 3×3 grid / dense mosaic / stacked list]`. The completed array HOLDS, alive but resting: a gentle continuous parallax/sine FLOAT on the tiles and/or a slow camera push-in (faint scale-up). Optional `[accent-color]` glow TRAVELS across/behind the tiles.
- **Scene 3 (~Xs–end) — settle / reveal / exit.** Everything settles and holds to the end, OR the optional camera modifier runs (see below), OR a `[closing line / CTA]` book-ends the array. OR the field CLEARS to payoff copy — the array exits and a concise centered `[claim / price / URL]` lands (price via a very fast character snap-build with a split-second partial state; URL via a left-to-right reveal, holding in `[accent]` and flipping to `[ink]` only in the final beat) — OR the camera PUSHES THROUGH one highlighted `[hero item]` (single rapid accelerating push-in) and crossfades into a second, vaster receding `[word-grid depth field]` that continuously scales down to reveal ever more items before fading to the payoff.

Variants (where roles diverge from the template):

- **Variant — Key_Feature grid**: items are labeled `[icon + feature-label]` tiles/pills assembling into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid; near-static hold with slow push-in + optional traveling-glow sweep; headline book-ends (`[hook]` → `[CTA]`). No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature glass-card-reveal**: the assemble is CAMERA-DRIVEN, not element-stagger. Open tight on `[2–3 glowing icons]`; camera zoom-OUT grows `[N]` glass cards out from behind the icons (icons shrink ~50% to become card headers), `[center card]` scales ~105% and moves forward to overlap the sides (quick spring); cards hold side-by-side with continuous parallax float; exit = fast motion-blur SWEEP slides the cards off-frame.
- **Variant — Benefits vertical-list**: a single vertical `[benefit-line]` stack, ~1 item/sec, three sub-modes — (a) BUILD: each line stays fully lit; entry = `[marker]` spring-pop + `[check/icon]` draw-in + `[pill]` mask-wipe of the text; (b) SNAP: the whole stack steps up one slot per beat (~0.1s eased) so the newest line lands in the bright focal slot and lines leaving it dim by position; (c) STREAM: the list scrolls rapidly and continuously past the focal slot — center item opaque `[ink]` and slightly enlarged, neighbors faded/shrunk — then DECELERATES to stop on the `[chosen item]`; optionally split-framed against a fixed static `[label]` on the opposite side; the field then clears to a centered `[payoff line]`. Static camera; optional perpetual `[decorative orbit/disc]` on the opposite side. No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature live-populate**: the assemble is a DATA-POPULATION wave, cursorless, frame locked (± one gentle opening zoom-out that makes room for the `[headline]`). Two board shapes — (a) ANCHORED: `[white data cards]` spring in one-by-one, each tethered by a thin line to its `[marker]` on a `[map/board surface]` whose markers pulse (expanding fading rings); (b) TABULAR: new `[columns]` appear as grey skeleton pills, progress fills run left→right staggered top-to-bottom (colored fill with a leading tip), each bar SWAPPING to its real `[value/avatar chip]` on completion. After assembly the array stays LIVE: `[status pills]` flip states in quick snappy swaps (color-coded, several in succession), or the `[headline]` crossfades and a second population wave runs on a newly revealed region — the table content scrolling horizontally beneath a sticky first column to expose it. Hold lands on the fully populated, fully updated final state.
- **Variant — Social_Proof logo-wall-zoom-out**: intro beat (`[trusted-by headline]` card OR a `[product screenshot]`) crossfades/cuts to a center logo grid that builds (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up); a continuous camera zoom-OUT then shrinks the whole grid toward center to reveal a vast ecosystem and holds; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional exit = whole grid SLIDES UP and flies out through the top.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- item stagger-assemble into slot → `center-outward-expansion` (per-item stagger + short-path slide variant; for a wall too dense for a true center burst, use it in its "starting partially-spread"/direct-into-slot form — see merge tension)
- brick/grid/list layout resolve → `center-outward-expansion` (target positions = final layout slots)
- randomized pop-in stagger → `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe; randomized `from`/order)
- column slide-up into grid → `gsap-effects` (per-column staggered slide-up)
- vertical-list step / slot-machine snap-and-hold → `vertical-spring-ticker` (STEPS = number of line advances)
- spring-overshoot marker pop → `spring-pop-entrance` (back.out spring) — also `gsap-effects` for the staggered pop chain
- check / icon draw-in inside marker → `svg-path-draw`
- live line-art icon in a tile (internal parts) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- pill / label mask-wipe text reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal)
- dim-by-position de-emphasis → `gsap-effects` (per-line opacity by slot position; no dedicated rule)
- line-by-line headline fill → `discrete-text-sequence`
- accent-gradient proof number count-up → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- gentle parallax / sine float on hold → `sine-wave-loop` (apply the concurrent-elements amplitude `/√N` rule for a held grid)
- slow camera push-in → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase pattern)
- center-card scale-up + forward overlap → `spring-pop-entrance` (the quick spring) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (z-depth overlap)
- cards-grow-from-behind-icons / icon-shrink-to-header → driven by the camera reveal (`multi-phase-camera`) — the grow/shrink are scale tweens chorded to the pull-back phase; no separate rule
- fixed HUD / viewfinder brackets → `ai-tracking-box` (static-bracket variant — overlay frame, not tracking)
- book-end headline fade → `discrete-text-sequence` (or `gsap-effects` fade)
- perpetual decorative orbit / disc / loop → `sine-wave-loop` (or `orbit-3d-entry` if it's an orbiting badge ring)
- traveling-glow sweep across/behind tiles → `ambient-glow-bloom` (one-pass traveling glow sweep across the tiles)
- motion-blur slide-out sweep (glass-card exit) → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast sweep that carries the cards off-frame)
- grid slide-up fly-out exit → `gsap-effects` (plain staggered translate-off-frame; no dedicated rule needed — a basic exit tween, not a missing capability)
- skeleton-pill progress fill → `stat-bars-and-fills` (progress-fill `scaleX` form; the leading tip is a chorded child element)
- fill-completes-swap-to-real-data / live status-pill flips / headline crossfade between waves → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds — the pill's states are text states)
- staggered top-to-bottom fill cascade → `gsap-effects` (per-row stagger on the fill tweens)
- tethered-card spring-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (the card) + `avatar-cloud-network` (the thin connection-line-to-anchor layout; anchor coordinates must match the marker exactly) + `svg-path-draw` if the tether draws in
- pulsing marker rings → `cursor-click-ripple` (its expanding-ring + attack-decay opacity envelope, minus the cursor/click, on a bounded repeat)
- sticky-column internal horizontal scroll → `viewport-change` (PAN form on the inner column layer; the sticky column sits outside the panned layer) — mark the moving layer `data-layout-allow-overflow` and clip at the table card
- rapid vertical stream past a focal slot + deceleration stop → `vertical-spring-ticker` (continuous form: one long decelerating translate instead of its stepped tweens; focal-slot emphasis reuses the dim-by-position mapping above)
- pill-widens-as-label-fills → `card-morph-anchor`'s substitution law (uniform `scaleX`/clip-path — never tween `width`) + `discrete-text-sequence` for the label fill
- push-through-the-hero-item exit → `multi-phase-camera` (single accelerating push phase) aimed via `coordinate-target-zoom` at the highlighted chip, crossfading at peak
- receding word-grid depth field → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ continuously — the zoom-OUT reveal grammar pointed at a word field; size/opacity tiers fake the depth)
- price snap-build (split-second partial state) → `discrete-text-sequence` (non-linear typing with bulk additions — exactly its typo/partial-state mechanic)
- left-to-right URL reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal — same mapping as the pill mask-wipe); the final-beat color flip → `gsap-effects` (a `tl.set` at the beat — basic, no rule needed)

**camera modifier — zoom-OUT reveal** (optional; the role-defining move for the glass-card and logo-wall variants): a camera wrapper around the whole array scales DOWN over the hold, revealing the assembled grid/cards sitting inside a larger environment (ecosystem scale, or a row of cards unfolding from tight icons).

- Continuous single-pass zoom-out (Social_Proof ecosystem pull-back) → `viewport-change` (one wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ via onUpdate — single source of truth)
- Phased pull-back → focus → settle, with built-in drift (Key_Feature tight-icons → cards-unfold) → `multi-phase-camera` (use the "Dramatic reveal: push → neutral → pull" / pull-back phase pattern; grow/shrink of cards chords to the pull-back phase)

---

```
BLUEPRINT: grid-card-assemble — serves Key_Feature, Benefits, Social_Proof (folded 4 drafts + 2 mined clusters: live-data-populate-board, item-field-to-payoff-card)
RULE COVERAGE: complete, no gaps — traveling-glow sweep → ambient-glow-bloom; motion-blur slide-out sweep (exit) → motion-blur-streak; grid slide-up fly-out (exit) → gsap-effects (plain translate); skeleton-fill populate → stat-bars-and-fills + discrete-text-sequence; push-through-hero exit → multi-phase-camera + coordinate-target-zoom
```

Merge tension: `center-outward-expansion` (the natural backing for stagger-assemble) caps cleanly at 3–8 items and explicitly warns 8+ causes mid-flight overlap chaos — but a Social_Proof logo wall is deliberately dense (12+ tiles), so for that variant the items must NOT burst from a shared center; they slide a short distance directly into their own slot (the rule's "starting partially-spread"/short-path form, or a `gsap-effects` per-item stagger), which the consolidated Scene-1 verb already specifies as "short distance directly into its slot."

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

| token      | range                                   | notes                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZOOM_SCALE | 1.5× modest → 3× dominant → 5×+ extreme | cap via the headroom budget; raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × ZOOM_SCALE` |
| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
